# Python Projects

Welcome to my personal repository of Python projects! This repository contains a collection of projects I have worked on, and I will be adding more as I continue to explore and develop new ideas.

## Projects

### 1. Hangman Game
A simple implementation of the classic Hangman game. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. If they make too many incorrect guesses, the hangman is "completed" and they lose the game.

#### Features
- Draws a hangman graphic as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- Allows the player to input guesses and checks them against the word.
- Provides a definition of the word at the end of the game using the Dictionary API.

#### Installation
- **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-projects.git
    cd python-projects/hangman
    ```

- **Install the `requests` library**:
    ```
    bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **Create a `words.txt` file** in the `hangman` directory:
    ```
    plaintext
    apple
    banana
    cherry
    date
    elderberry
    ```

- **Run the script**:
    ```
    bash
    python main.py
    ```

### 2. Movie Synopsis Creator
This script fetches movie synopses from the OMDb API and creates a synopsis file for each movie in a specified directory. 

#### Features
- Fetches movie details using the OMDb API.
- Generates text files with movie synopses.
- Organizes and manages movie collection with automatically generated synopses.

#### Installation
- **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-projects.git
    cd python-projects/movie-synopsis
    ```

- **Install the required packages**:
    ```
    bash
    pip install requests python-dotenv
    ```

- **Create a `.env` file** in the `movie-synopsis` directory:
    ```
    plaintext
    API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

- **Run the script**:
    ```
    bash
    python main.py
    ```
